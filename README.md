# hyperview-spaces

This folder is intended to be a **standalone repository** for Hugging Face Space deployments. Our demo at https://huggingface.co/spaces/hyper3labs/HyperView follows the template described here. 

Recommended GitHub repository name:

- `hyperview-spaces`

## Purpose

- Keep Space deployment logic separate from the core HyperView codebase
- Reuse one template pattern for multiple Space demos
- Deploy each demo folder to a different Hugging Face Space via GitHub Actions

## Intended reuse flow

This repo is meant to be easy to hand to an external coding agent.

The happy path is:

1. Copy one folder from `spaces/`
2. Edit the constants block at the top of that folder's `demo.py`
3. Update the Space `README.md`
4. Add or retarget one deploy workflow

Both official examples install released packages from PyPI. Keep custom Space
logic in `demo.py` and Space-local files so contributors can copy a folder,
change their dataset settings, and open a PR without carrying an internal
source snapshot.

The current Imagenette example is intentionally simple and keeps the editable
dataset/model choices in one place so agents do not need to coordinate Docker
args, runtime environment variables, and Python script flags.

## Create Your Own Hugging Face Space

Use the Imagenette example as a copyable starter.

1. Create a new Space at https://huggingface.co/new-space.
2. Choose a distinct Space name such as `yourproject-HyperView` or `HyperView-yourproject`.
3. Select `Docker` as the Space SDK.
4. Create the Space. Hugging Face will initialize it as a git-backed Docker Space with `sdk: docker` in `README.md`.
5. In this repository, copy `spaces/imagenette-clip-hycoclip` to a new folder such as `spaces/yourproject-hyperview`.
6. Edit `spaces/yourproject-hyperview/demo.py` and change the constants block at the top of the file.
7. Edit `spaces/yourproject-hyperview/README.md` and rename the copied example from `HyperView` to your own project name.
8. Keep the Space name consistent across the Hugging Face Space ID, the README frontmatter `title`, and the Markdown H1. Good patterns are `yourproject-HyperView` and `HyperView-yourproject`.
9. Copy `.github/workflows/deploy-hf-space-imagenette.yml` to a new workflow file and update `name`, `concurrency`, `paths`, `source_dir`, and `space_id`.
10. Configure the GitHub Actions secrets `HF_USERNAME` and `HF_TOKEN`. The token must have write access to the target Hugging Face Space.
11. Push to `main` or run the workflow manually with `workflow_dispatch`.
12. Keep the Dockerfile on released PyPI packages such as `hyperview==0.3.1` or `hyperview[ml]==0.3.1` instead of vendoring `hyperview` into the Space folder.
13. Check the Hugging Face Space logs to confirm the Docker image built and the container started on port `7860`.

### Optional Local Test

From the `hyperview-spaces` repository root:

```bash
docker build -t yourproject-hyperview spaces/yourproject-hyperview
docker run --rm -p 7860:7860 yourproject-hyperview
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

## Contribute Your Space Back

If you want your Space to appear in this repository as a community example:

1. Fork this repository or create a branch if you already have write access.
2. Add your Space folder under `spaces/<your-slug>`.
3. Rename the copied `HyperView` title and heading to your own project name such as `yourproject-HyperView` or `HyperView-yourproject`.
4. Add or update a deploy workflow for your folder if this repository should deploy it.
5. Add a row for your Space in the community table below.
6. Open a pull request describing the Hugging Face Space ID, dataset source, embedding models, and whether the deploy workflow is expected to run from this repository.

Important: deployment workflows in this repository use the shared `HF_USERNAME` and `HF_TOKEN` GitHub secrets. A contributed workflow will only deploy successfully if that token has write access to the target Space.

## Community Contributed Spaces

Add one row here when you contribute a new Space.

| HyperView - Imagenette | `hyper3labs/HyperView` | `spaces/imagenette-clip-hycoclip` | Hyper3Labs | Official example | Copyable starter template |
| HyperView - Jaguar Re-ID | `hyper3labs/HyperView-Jaguar-ReID` | `spaces/jaguar-reid-megadescriptor-spherical` | Hyper3Labs | Official example | Advanced `timm-image` + spherical example using released `hyperview[ml]` |

## About precomputed Lance data

Yes, you can ship precomputed LanceDB artifacts with the image. There are two valid options:

1. **Build-time precompute** (current default)
   - `RUN python -c "from demo import build_dataset; build_dataset()"`
   - Artifacts are baked into the Docker image layers
2. **Commit precomputed artifacts into this repo**
   - Useful when startup determinism is critical
   - Usually requires careful size control (and potentially Git LFS)

For now, this repo uses option 1.
